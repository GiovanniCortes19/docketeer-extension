This is currently just stuff that doesn't work

<h2>Techs</h2>
<h3>cAdvisor</h3>
cAdvisor has been deprecated and we won't need it anymore once Docketeer is a Docker desktop extension, we should be able to get the info from the docker sock itself instead of needing this inbetween.

<h2>Files</h2>
Any files with a '?' are tentatively in their sections, need to search deeper to be sure

<h3>Currently unimplemented files</h3>
<pre>
security/email.js
src/components/AccountDisplay/AccountDisplay.tsx
src/components/ProcessLogsCards/ProcessLogsCard.tsx?
src/components/Settings/Settings.tsx
